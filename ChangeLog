2006-03-24 (0.3-3)  Jun Yan  <jyan@.stat.uiowa.edu>

	* added support for linbugs (OpenBUGS on Linux). 
	Support for WinBUGS via Wine is no longer necessary.
	* added an option `genFilesOnly' for function `rbugs' 
	to generate script files, inits files, data file, and 
	model file in a given directory.
	* dic is now an option. 
	It was always computed in previous releases, but sometimes 
	computing dic may be very time-consuming, for example, 
	in spatial modeling. It's desirable to not to compute 
	dic at least for exploratory analysis.
